# Path-Finding Algorithms  

## Overview  
This repository explores the implementation and comparison of various path-finding algorithms in a grid-based environment. 

### 1. Basic Path-Finding  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Implement and visualize the algorithm to find a path to the goal using a stack-based approach.  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Implement and visualize the algorithm using a queue-based approach.  
- **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate the algorithms based on:  
  - Path length  
  - Number of visited tiles  
  - Maximum size of the waiting list during execution  

### 2. Optimal Path-Finding with Costs  
- **Cost Management:** Introduce tile costs, with higher costs assigned to specific regions of the grid.  
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:** Implement the algorithm to find the minimum-cost path and visualize its execution.  
- **A* Algorithm:** Design an admissible heuristic and implement A*, comparing its performance and results with Dijkstra's algorithm.  

## Purpose  
This project aims to explore the fundamental principles of path-finding algorithms, demonstrating how different data structures, cost metrics, and heuristics affect their efficiency and outcomes.  

## Features  
- Implementation of DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms.  
- Visualization of algorithm iterations, waiting lists, and visited nodes.  
- Comparison of path lengths, costs, and algorithmic efficiency.
